# Chapter 8: Error Handling and Debugging


## Overview
Effective error handling and debugging are crucial for developing robust Ruby applications. This chapter covers common error types in Ruby, how to handle them gracefully, and techniques to debug your code efficiently.

## Common Ruby Errors
Understanding common error types can help you quickly diagnose issues in your code.

### Syntax Errors
Syntax errors occur when the code is not written in a valid Ruby format.

### Example of a Syntax Error
```ruby
if x > 5
puts "X is greater than 5"
end
```

### Runtime Errors
Runtime errors happen during the execution of the code, such as attempting to divide by zero.


### Example of a Runtime Error
```ruby
result = 10 / 0

```

## Error Handling
Ruby uses the begin, rescue, ensure, and end block to handle errors.

### Example of Error Handling
```ruby
begin
  result = 10 / 0
rescue ZeroDivisionError
  puts "Attempted to divide by zero."
ensure
  puts "This code runs no matter what."
end
```


## Debugging Techniques
Identifying and fixing bugs is an essential skill for any programmer.

### Using `puts` and `p`
Simple debugging can involve placing puts or p statements to output the value of variables at certain points in your application.

### Using Ruby's Debugger
Ruby includes tools like byebug or debugger which can be included in your code to stop execution and allow you to inspect variables and step through code.

### Example Using byebug
```ruby
require 'byebug'

def calculate_value(x, y)
  byebug
  x / y
end

calculate_value(10, 0)
```
